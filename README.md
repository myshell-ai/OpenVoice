## Introduction
As we detailed in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01479) and [website](https://research.myshell.ai/open-voice), the advantages of OpenVoice are three-fold:

**1. Accurate Tone Color Cloning.**
OpenVoice can accurately clone the reference tone color and generate speech in multiple languages and accents.

**2. Flexible Voice Style Control.**
OpenVoice enables granular control over voice styles, such as emotion and accent, as well as other style parameters including rhythm, pauses, and intonation. 

**3. Zero-shot Cross-lingual Voice Cloning.**
Neither of the language of the generated speech nor the language of the reference speech needs to be presented in the massive-speaker multi-lingual training dataset.

OpenVoice has been powering the instant voice cloning capability of [myshell.ai](https://app.myshell.ai/explore) since May 2023. Until Nov 2023, the voice cloning model has been used tens of millions of times by users worldwide, and witnessed the explosive user growth on the platform.
